Hello! My name is Ali Raza and I am one of the teaching assistants for CS3380.   
I have office hours held at Naka Hall (EBW) in room 239 twice a week:
- 1PM-3PM on Tuesday
- 1PM-2PM on Thursday

I will use this repo to host all the code I present in class. I may also post solutions to labs and homeworks on here.
